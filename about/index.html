<h1>about jack moffitt</h1>

<p>I'm an entrepreneur and a hacker.</p>

<p>My current project is called <a href="http://www.chesspark.com/">Chesspark</a> and is an online community for chess players built on top of technologies like <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (aka Jabber), AJAX, and <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>

<p>Previously I created the <a href="http://www.icecast.org/">Icecast Streaming Media Server</a>, spent a lot of time developing and managing the <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg Vorbis</a> project, and helping create and run the <a href="http://www.xiph.org/">Xiph.org Foundation</a>.  All these efforts exist to create a common, royalty free, and open standard for multimedia on the Internet.</p>

<p>I am passionate about Free Software and Open Source, technology, music, and photography.</p>

<p>You may contact me at jack at metajack.im.</p>
