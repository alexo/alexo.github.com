I'll be giving a [presentation](http://codebits.sapo.pt/intra/s/speaker/11) on [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org) in Lisbon, Portugal on the 13th of November at [SAPO Codebits 2008](http://codebits.sapo.pt).  My presentation is tentatively called *Exploring XMPP*, and here's the brief description:

> XMPP is not just for chat clients and servers.  The protocol provides
a rich API for real time applications.  We will cover some basic
concepts in the protocol and use these concepts to design a powerful
application.  The ideas we will talk about include presence, basic
messaging, ad-hoc commands, Web interfaces, and publish-subscribe.
