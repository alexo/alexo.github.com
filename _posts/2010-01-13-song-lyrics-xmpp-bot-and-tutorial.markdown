There is a new XMPP bot in town, which delivers song lyrics right to
your IM client. [Abhi](http://abhinavsingh.com/) has written a song
lyrics bot ([lyricsfly@gtalkbots.com](xmpp:lyricsfly@gtalkbots.com)
and [shared the design
details](http://abhinavsingh.com/blog/2010/01/get-lyrics-for-any-song-using-xmpp-and-php-right-into-your-im-add-lyricsflygtalkbots-com/)
on his blog.

He wrote the bot in PHP using the
[JAXL](http://code.google.com/p/jaxl) XMPP library. It appears as
though he is the author of the library as well. It will be good for
[XMPPHP](http://code.google.com/p/xmpphp/) to have a little
competition.

At the end of his post, Abhi also has a short tutorial for writing
your own XMPP bots with JAXL.

If you're a PHP programmer and interested in XMPP, these seem like
they'd be very helpful.
