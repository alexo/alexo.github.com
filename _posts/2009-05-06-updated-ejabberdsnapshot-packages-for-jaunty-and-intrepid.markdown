My [Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~metajack/+archive/ppa) now
has updated packages for [ejabberd](http://www.ejabberd.im) fresh from
the [Subversion
repository](http://svn.process-one.net/ejabberd/trunk).  These are now
available for both Intrepid Ibex and Jaunty Jackalope.

For those of you running Intrepid, I also recommend you upgrade
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) to R12B5 which is also available in my
PPA.

Next up on my list of packaging tasks is to make Erlang R13B packages
for Jaunty and to update the Wokkel packages to a recent version.

Enjoy!
