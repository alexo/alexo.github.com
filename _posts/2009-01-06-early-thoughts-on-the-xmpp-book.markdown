Over the holidays I have been doing a technical review of the upcoming
XMPP book "XMPP: The Definitive Guide".  It's currently available as a
[rough cut from O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596157197/)
and I expect the final version is getting near.  I still have a bit to
go, but so far I think it is fantastic.

This will be a great introduction and reference to a lot of the most
useful bits of the XMPP protocol stack.  It becomes clear when reading
the book just how much care and thought has gone into the design of
these protocols.  

Specifically the chapters on instant messaging and XMPP pubsub have
stood out to me.

The downside of all this is that no one warned me how much work a book
review is, or perhaps I just want to be thorough.  My ratio of lines
of comment to pages is currently hovering around 3 to 1.  It is mostly
small stuff because the text is already in great shape.  

[Peter](http://stpeter.im), [Kevin](http://www.kismith.co.uk), and
[Remko](http://el-tramo.be) have done a wonderful job, and their hard
work really shows.
