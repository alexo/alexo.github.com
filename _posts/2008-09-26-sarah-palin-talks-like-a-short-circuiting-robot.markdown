After watching the first few interviews with Sarah Palin (watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npUMUASwaec) for an example), my first thought was that it sounded like her text was being generated by Markov chains.  Apparently I'm not the only one that [thinks this](http://www.metafilter.com/75174/Oh-sht#2274294).  I decided to have a little fun and created a Web site that generates new Sarah Palin interview answers by using Markov chains to generate new text from the transcripts of her interviews.

The hilarious result is [InterviewPalin.com](http://interviewpalin.com).   If you find a particularly good one, please post it in a comment!

I'll be posting the code, written in Python and using twisted.web, over the weekend.
