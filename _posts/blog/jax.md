# From Design Thinking to DevOps and Back Again: Unifying Design and Operations
First keynote.
There is no definition of done. The software is continuously being changed and improved.

# The Performance Model of Streams in Java 8
Is using parallel stream faster? It depends!

# Java Generics: Past, Present and Future
How all started. Why generics were introduced.
How are they used in present.



# From 1 RPM to 1,000 RPM â€“ Succeeding in a Software-Defined Economy

why do we do software?
IT is for business (supporting IT or making it more competitive). Ex: for the business to make more money or spend less money.

IT is not only for business, IT is business.

Software is what truly differentiate a product.

Example: VW vs Tesla - updating software (years vs seconds)

Traditional Development vs Continuous Delivery.
Reduce risk & cost by releasing often. Push your changes to production in an easy fashion.

Automation is key to fast iteration.

Steps:
* Embrace CI
* Embrace Devops and CD
* Educate the business. Start with MVP and iterate.
* Start small. Pick a POC.
* Advertise your win. Make it a business case - not a technical one.
* Iterate. Big bang solutions never work.

Software is what will make or kill companies.
Developers have a huge opportunity ahead ... but also a great responsibility.
