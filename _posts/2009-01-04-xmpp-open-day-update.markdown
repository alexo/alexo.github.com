XMPP Open Day is starting to shape up, but it still needs you help.
We currently have 5 presenters, 6 talks, and 2 volunteer moderators.
This is a great start, but we definitely need some more people to give
talks or lead panels.

Please sign up at the [wiki
page](http://wiki.jabber.org/web/XMPP_Open_Day) or [e-mail
me](mailto:jack@metajack.im) if you're thinking you might want to
participate.
