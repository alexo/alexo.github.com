I am constantly finding new Strophe related projects and blog
posts. Here are two that I found this week:

* [Objective-J wrapper for
  Strophe.js](http://shadowfiend.posterous.com/strophej-an-objective-j-wrapper-for-strophejs)
* [GWT bindings for
  Strophe.js](http://jprieur.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/gwt-bindings-for-the-strophe-xmpp-library/)

If anyone has used these, please tell me about them in the comments. I
haven't had the pleasure to use GWT or Objective-J/Cappuccino yet, but
I'm happy to see Strophe in more places.
