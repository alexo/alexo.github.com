As some of you may already know, I've been hard at work writing a book
on XMPP programming for Wiley/Wrox. It's called <a
href='http://professionalxmpp.com'><cite>Professional XMPP Programming
with JavaScript and jQuery<cite></a>. The book is currently at the
printer and is scheduled for publication at December 21.

You can pre-order the book from <a
href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470540710?tag=metajack-20'>Amazon</a>
(<a
href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470540710?tag=metajack-20'>US</a>
or <a
href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470540710?tag=metajack-20'>UK</a>).

<a href='http://professionalxmpp.com'><cite>Professional XMPP
Programming</cite></a> is a book about code, not just about protocol
details. It contains eleven applications of increasing complexity,
starting from a simple "Hello, World!" application and finishing with
a real-time, multi-player gaming system for Tic-Tac-Toe. All the
applications are written in JavaScript and use the jQuery and Strophe
libraries, but the principles are generally applicable.

Both basic protocol topics and some advanced topics are also covered,
including how to deploy, scale, and optimize your XMPP constructions.

Wiley has kindly agreed to release two chapters for free. <a
href='http://professionalxmpp.com/profxmpp_ch04.pdf'>Chapter 4</a>,
containing the book's second application, Peek, is an XMPP protocol
debuging console to aid you in your XMPP adventures. <a
href='http://professionalxmpp.com/profxmpp_ch14.pdf'>Chapter 14</a>
covers the Strophe plugin system, showing how to use and develop your
own Strophe plugins.

All the <a href='http://github.com/metajack/profxmpp'>code for the
book</a> is available on GitHub.

I hope you all enjoy the free chapters, and I encourage to <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470540710?tag=metajack-20'>buy</a> and
read the rest of the book. I think you'll like it!
