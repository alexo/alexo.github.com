On April 24th and 25th I'll be at the first ever [JS
Conference](http://www.jsconf2009.com) in Washington, DC.  While
there, I'll be giving a talk about using Strophe to make XMPP powered
Web applications in JavaScript.

We've had a lot of fun using JavaScript to create
[Chesspark](http://www.chesspark.com),
[Speeqe](http://www.speeqe.com), and now
[Stanziq](http://www.stanziq.com).  If you're interested in creating
cool, XMPP powered, real time Web applications, come join me; it'll be
a lot of fun!
