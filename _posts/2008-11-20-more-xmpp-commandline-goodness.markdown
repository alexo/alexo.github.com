[Seth](http://github.com/mojodna) from the [Yahoo Fire Eagle](http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/) team e-mailed me today about [Poetry](http://launchpad.net/poetry), our XMPP commandline tools project.  It seems that Seth has been thinking along the same lines, and he has created [switchboard](http://github.com/mojodna/switchboard/tree), a similar tool written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).  It appears switchboard is a little farther along than Poetry.  Check out the [README file](http://github.com/mojodna/switchboard/tree/master/README.markdown) for usage examples.

The more tools the merrier I say.
