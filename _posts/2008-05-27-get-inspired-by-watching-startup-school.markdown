I've been going through the <a href="http://omnisio.com/startupschool08">startup school 08 videos</a> today and have found them both interesting and inspiring.  For example, David Heinemeier Hansson talks about <a href="http://omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08">a simple solution for profits</a> (having a price), and Paul Graham talks about <a href="http://omnisio.com/startupschool08/paul-graham-at-startup-school-08">how benevolence helps you succeed</a>.

I still have a bunch more to watch.
