Here's a collection of interesting XMPP-related updates from the
microblogging world this week:

> [#](http://twitter.com/null_hawk31/status/7881128904)

For most use cases, I certainly agree.

Too bad he didn't provide a link to the paper. I'd love to hear more.

I think this person is a little late to the party.

Yet another group that thinks XMPP and cloud computing will go
together well.

An oldie, but a goodie.

XMPP use is growing more every day. I wonder how many of these are
Google Talk accounts?

There already is a start of a [microblogging
XEP](http://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/microblogging.html), but it
needs a bit of work. It's always good to have more people working on
this.

Facebook plans to support XMPP, and I think it's only a matter of time
before the old, proprietary networks cave as well.

I hope you enjoy it!

I don't think it gets more brutally technical than [RFC
3920](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html) and [RFC
3921](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3921.html).

This was sorely missed while it was gone. Many XMPP folks hang out
primarily on [Identica](http://identi.ca), but sometimes the XMPP
support there gets the shaft during upgrades.

XMPP is taking over the world, one success story at a time.

This is exactly why XMPP is achieving success. Why build it again,
when so many great extensions are already there?

I encourage everyone interesting in XMPP to apply. Come help us make
the [XMPP Standards Foundation](http://xmpp.org) even better.

I can't tell if this is scary or awesome or both.

You heard it first on Twitter folks, XMPP is even easier to use than
an iPhone!

I hope to see all of you there!

I find this extremely funny. Most of the sports-related businesses
I've heard of are all about fast, targeted data delivery. Sounds like
an industry designed for pubsub.

I think it's the basis for the new real-time stack. I expect to see
many more services in the future.

I think expect and netcat would win this contest, but it's an
interesting exercise to think about.
