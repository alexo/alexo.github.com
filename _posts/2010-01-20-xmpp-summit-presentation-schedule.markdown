The [schedule for
presentations](http://xmpp.org/summit/summit8.shtml#saturday) at the
[8th XMPP Summit](http://xmpp.org/summit/summit8.shtml) has been
posted today, and there are some great ones.

The day starts off with XMPP 101, an introduction to XMPP. Next up is
an open question and answer panel, staffed by the [XMPP
Council](http://xmpp.org/xsf/council/), the authors of [XMPP: The
Definitive
Guide](http://www.amazon.com/dp/059652126X/?tag=metajack-20) and
myself. I think the Q&A session has a lot of potential; I regularly
answer a lot of XMPP questions via e-mail, and I'm always surprised at
how people are using XMPP. I think even the experts will learn a lot.

Once the ball is rolling, there are three talks about XMPP and social
networks, all from different perspectives. I think this will be very
interesting and provide a lot of inspiration and food for thought.

I'm giving a talk on [Strophe.js](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe), of
course, following the social networking section.

There will be two sets of lightning talks, and I expect we'll see some
great demos of XMPP projects and discussions of all sorts.

The last section contains two talks on
[Jingle](http://xmpp.org/tech/jingle.shtml) as well as a pubsub
related talk by [Ralph Meijer](http://ralphm.net). Ralph works on so
many crazy and awesome  projects; I can't wait to see what he's been
up to since I saw him last.

Hopefully we can get some or all of these talks on video for those of
you who can't attend in person.

So far, this is shaping up to be the best XMPP Summit yet.
