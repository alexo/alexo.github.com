If you're interested in [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org) and will be in
Austin on March 17th, 2009, please join us at the [XMPP
meetup](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2122123).  Everyone is
welcome, XMPP users, developers, and anyone who is interested in
learning more.

I've been trying to organize an XMPP meetup in Austin during SXSW, and
thanks to the efforts of Marcus Irven of [Minggl](http://minggl.com)
and the [Conjunctured co-working space](http://conjunctured.com/), the
event is officially happening.

I'll be there with a few coworkers from [Stanziq](http://stanziq.com)
and [Chesspark](http://www.chesspark.com) along with Marcus from
[Minggl](http://minggl.com), and I believe there will be a few current
and former Googlers there as well.  

Please let me know if you'd like to do a small presentation on
something cool you are working on.  I hope to meet some new people and
have a great time talking about XMPP.
