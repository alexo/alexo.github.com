In my recent automake explorations, I discovered the following [email
thread](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2008-12/msg00013.html)
where someone has taken up the task of making automake builds much
less verbose.

> There have been a number of attempts at introducing a quiet behavior to
automake, much like the Linux kernel's kbuild does. (...) This patch
does it...

It's still being hashed out with the automake maintainers, but the
authors seems dedicated to the task.  It looks like we will quieter
builds where we can see errors and warnings clearly really soon.
