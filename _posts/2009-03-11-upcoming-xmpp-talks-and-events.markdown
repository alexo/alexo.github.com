There are a lot of XMPP events in the near future, and we'd love to
see you at a few of them.

* The first XMPP Monthly Meeting (March 12) will be in the
  jdev@conference.jabber.org MUC room.  [Peter](http://stpeter.im) has
  posted more details [here](https://stpeter.im/?p=2528).
* The SXSW XMPP Meetup (March 17) will be in Austin, Texas.  Details can
  be found on the [meetup
  page](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2122123/).  There are already
  15 people going, and about the same amount marked as interested.
  It's looking like it will be a great event.  Besides myself, there
  will also be Julien from [Notifixio.us](http://notifixio.us) and
  Marcus from [Minggl](http://minggl.com).  I'm sure a lot of
  interesting discussions will take place regarding XMPP and Web
  applications.
* IETF 74 (March 22-27) will be in San Francisco, and two sessions
  will have XMPP focused content, both on March 23rd.  The first is
  the [App area open
  meeting](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/09mar/agenda/apparea.txt)
  in which we'll be talking about BOSH, WebSockets, and Bayeux.  The
  second is the XMPP BOF session where various XMPP related topics
  will be covered.  [Peter](http://stpeter.im) and I will both be
  there, and I believe some of the [Isode](http://www.isode.com) guys
  as well, one of whom is the first [XSF](http://xmpp.org) member to
  become an IETF Area Director.
* The all JavaScript [JSConf](http://jsconf2009.com/) (April 24-25)
  will be in Washington DC.  I'll be giving a presentation there on
  building XMPP powered Web applications.
* The [Glue conference](http://gluecon.com) (May 12-13) will be in
  Denver.  XMPP makes for great glue, and accordingly,
  [Peter](http://stpeter.im) and I will be on a panel along with
  others including [Seth Fitzsimmons](http://mojodna.net) of Yahoo's
  [Fire Eagle](http://fireeagle.yahoo.com) team.  This conference
  should be really great, and if you use the code "spkr09" to get a
  $100 discount on the already cheap conference.
* [OSCON 2009](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009) (July 20-24) will be
  in San Jose, CA this year instead of the usual Portland, OR
  location.  The [XSF](http://xmpp.org) is planning to have the 7th
  XMPP Summit during the conference, and there are some [XMPP related
  talks](https://stpeter.im/?p=2532) shaping up.  It should be even
  more fun than last year!

I'm sure this is not even a complete list; the number of events where
XMPP is popping up is growing every day.  Let me know if you've heard
of any that I've missed!
