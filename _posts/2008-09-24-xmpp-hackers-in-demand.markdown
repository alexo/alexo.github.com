Over the last several weeks I have had a lot of great conversations with people and companies exploring XMPP technology.  In almost every conversation I have been asked if I know some available developers looking for XMPP work.  I definitely do know quite a few, but they all seem to be very busy and happily employed.  The few freelancers I know are weighing multiple cool job offers.  It's great to see the demand building for XMPP experts, and I can't wait to see what all these guys need developers to build.

Here's a small list of companies I know are doing more and more with XMPP:

* [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca)
* [Yammer](http://www.yammer.com)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com)
* [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com)
* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com)
* [Gnip](http://www.gnip.com)
* [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com)
* [Google](http://www.google.com)
* and of course Stanziq and [Chesspark](http://www.chesspark.com)

This list is hardly complete and doesn't include the not-yet-launched companies I've talked to.   Let's not forget that there are a bunch of XMPP vendors as well: [Cisco (via Jabber, Inc)](http://www.cisco.com), [Process One](http://www.process-one.net), and [Jive Software](http://www.jivesoftware.com) just to name a few.

On another note, if you are looking for a new gig, I'm also looking for a new developer to join our team.  We have some great ideas (way beyond what we've built at Chesspark) and need another great collaborator.  [Email me](mailto:metajack@gmail.com) if you are interested.
