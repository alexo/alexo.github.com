If Belgium is a little far for you to travel to meet some fellow XMPP
afficionados at the [8th XMPP
Summit](http://xmpp.org/summit/summit8.shtml), you should consider the
[San Francisco XMPP
Meetup](http://technology.meetup.com/11/calendar/12290361/). These are
organized by [Julien](http://twitter.com/julien51) every few months,
and they are excellent.

I've attended a few of these, and I'm always surprised at just how
many interesting people show up. Some are experienced XMPP hackers,
but many are just curious.

Also, this one is at [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/), who are
also sponsoring the food and drinks. Seriously, don't miss this!
