When I look at commits on github I'm always impressed at how concise they are.  When I read a commit I can understand the intent of the change without getting distracted by the author's journey to get there.  In contrast when I look at my commits they tend to be smaller and more incremental and meandering as I work my way down some false starts until I get to the solution I want.  I'm guessing that I'm not alone in the way I work and recently discovered <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git-core/docs/git-rebase.html">git rebase</a> and an <a href="http://blog.madism.org/index.php/2007/09/09/138-git-awsome-ness-git-rebase-interactive">helpful tutorial</a> showing how I can continue to work in my meandering style but package my changes to hide the journey before publishing to the world on github.<br /><br />Let me show you what I mean with some changes I recently made to <a href="http://github.com/jscruggs/metric_fu/tree/master">metric_fu</a>.  Over the course of a few days I made 6 small commits as you can see below.<br /><br /><pre class="old_code"><br />> git log<br /><br />commit d4b18b16e982ac57741f7a0a12cb085bb9b0e840<br />Author: Alex Rothenberg <alex@alexrothenberg.com><br />Date:   Mon Jun 1 09:55:37 2009 -0400<br /><br />    reverted rakefile<br /><br />commit ebda1cb67a2f0f0a85e51469d70919fa7c27d318<br />Author: Alex Rothenberg <alex@alexrothenberg.com><br />Date:   Mon Jun 1 09:49:05 2009 -0400<br /><br />    refactoring of verify_dependencies<br /><br />commit 3d45903b64a772fd09ec07bf69880bdb29ae4944<br />Author: Alex Rothenberg <alex@alexrothenberg.com><br />Date:   Fri May 29 20:40:49 2009 -0400<br /><br />    runtime dependency check for all gems<br /><br />commit 36e269bf8f0edccfb39cc767182406cdaa16a559<br />Author: Alex Rothenberg <alex@alexrothenberg.com><br />Date:   Fri May 29 20:24:16 2009 -0400<br /><br />    logic for checking dependencies in generator base<br /><br />commit bb2ee9a983c6adf54a8c95ee5851c6f8d3bffaba<br />Author: Alex Rothenberg <alex@alexrothenberg.com><br />Date:   Fri May 29 19:38:21 2009 -0400<br /><br />    made rcov dependency figure itself out when generating rcov metrics<br /><br />commit 750b000e5563e917f21eb1b7837e8001fb53f688<br />Author: Alex Rothenberg <alex@alexrothenberg.com><br />Date:   Fri May 29 16:42:12 2009 -0400<br /><br />    removed gem dependency on rcov - to allow use of relevance-rcov or other github forks<br /><br />commit d6af5089adce9eeed4916a155c3bdaeb4be6771a<br />Author: Randy Souza <randy@farnsworth.(none)><br />Date:   Sat May 16 08:47:37 2009 +0800<br /><br />    Added a simple fix for cases where Saikuro results with nested information<br />    cause metrics:all to crash<br />    <br />    Signed-off-by: Jake Scruggs <jake.scruggs@gmail.com><br /><br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />I am going to combine all of these into a single commit using the incredible power of git rebase.  I find the last commit I do not want to change (the one made by Randy Souza on May 16th) and issue a git rebase command with that id.<br /><br /><pre class="old_code"><br />> git rebase --interactive d6af5089adce9eeed4916a155c3bdaeb4be6771a<br /></pre><br /><br />Now my editor comes up showing the 6 changes since then giving me options of what to do.  Its very powerful, I can reorder commits, combine commits, eliminate commits.  I'm going back in time to change the past!<br /><br /><pre class="old_code"><br />pick 750b000 removed gem dependency on rcov - to allow use of relevance-rcov or other github forks<br />pick bb2ee9a made rcov dependency figure itself out when generating rcov metrics<br />pick 36e269b logic for checking dependencies in generator base<br />pick 3d45903 runtime dependency check for all gems<br />pick ebda1cb refactoring of verify_dependencies<br />pick d4b18b1 reverted rakefile<br /><br /># Rebase d6af508..d4b18b1 onto d6af508<br />#<br /># Commands:<br />#  p, pick = use commit<br />#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending<br />#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit<br />#<br /># If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.<br /># However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.<br />#<br /></pre><br /><br />In my case I want to combine these into a single commit so I change all but the first pick command to a squash and save.<br /><br /><pre class="old_code"><br />pick 750b000 removed gem dependency on rcov - to allow use of relevance-rcov or other github forks<br />squash bb2ee9a made rcov dependency figure itself out when generating rcov metrics<br />squash 36e269b logic for checking dependencies in generator base<br />squash 3d45903 runtime dependency check for all gems<br />squash ebda1cb refactoring of verify_dependencies<br />squash d4b18b1 reverted rakefile<br /><br /># Rebase d6af508..d4b18b1 onto d6af508<br />#<br /># Commands:<br />#  p, pick = use commit<br />#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending<br />#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit<br />#<br /># If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.<br /># However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.<br />#<br /></pre><br /><br />It now gives me a chance to edit the new commit message which it defaults to the original messages concatenated together.
