My little [parody Web app](http://interviewpalin.com) of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin seems to have run its course now.  The traffic has subsided to a pretty low level and I'll probably shut the site down after the election.  For the curious:

* **940,000** impressions according to Google Analytics
* **$563** in AdSense revenue
* **1** day of coding

[Twisted](http://www.twistedmatrix.com) Web experienced only one minor problem when it ran out of file descriptors.  After I increased the file descriptor limit and switched to the epoll reactor, Twisted Web handled all the traffic without ever breaking a sweat.

The funniest thing for me is that all the ad revenue seems to have come from John McCain's presidential campaign based on the ad content.  Who knew that I could get paid for poking fun at his running mate.

Thanks to:

* **My Wife** for the initial corpus research for Palin and general encouragement
* **Christopher Zorn** for assisting me with system administration
* **Dandee Fleming and Ben Roberts** for testing and Biden research
* **[Matt McInerney](http://pixelspread.com/)** for the awesome site designs

I hope everyone got a nice laugh.  For the curious, the code is available [on Launchpad](https://code.launchpad.net/~metajack/+junk/interview).
