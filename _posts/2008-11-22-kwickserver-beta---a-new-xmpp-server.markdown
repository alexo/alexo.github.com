Peter from the [Kwickserver](http://www.kwickserver.info) team e-mailed me to let me know that the first beta release of their [mail and communication server](http://www.kwickserver.info/mwiki/index.php/Mail_General) has been released.  It appears that Kwickserver is attempting to create a unified communications server, and they have created an [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org) server alongside their e-mail server.

I'm unsure if this is just a re-packaging of some other XMPP and e-mail server, or if the Kwickserver team has actually created a new XMPP server.  In either case, it looks like an interesting project.  The work is GPL licensed and is funded by an [Austrian non-profit organization](http://www.nic.at/uebernic/firmendaten_impressum/internet_privatstiftung_austria).

It's distributed as an CD image for PC compatible hardware.  I assume this means that it is a live-CD based on one of the Linux distributions.  If one of you brave souls gives it a try, please report back and let us know more details.
