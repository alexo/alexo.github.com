This week is [Ubuntu Open Week](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek), a week of presentations and Q&A sessions put on by the Ubuntu community.  These are held in IRC, and the topics range from how to build packages to how to use Ubuntu for media production.  I thought it might be fun to organize a similar event around [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org) for those who can't make it to the XMPP Summits. We would hold the event in one or more [multi-user chat](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html) rooms and various XMPP members could do presentations as well as Q&A sessions.

Here are some topic ideas I had.

* Setting up your first XMPP server
* Advanced server setup with clustering, BOSH, and components
* Protocol basics
* [Pubsub](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) and [PEP](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html)
* Multi-user chat
* [Data forms]( http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html) and [ad-hoc commands](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0050.html)
* XMPP Web applications with [Strophe](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe)
* Programming your first bot
* Q&A with server developers

Please let me know if this would be interesting for you or your company.  I don't think it would be too hard to organize, and I think those of us doing presentations would have a lot of fun.  Also, if you have other topic ideas, please let me know in the comments.
