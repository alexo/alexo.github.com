Albuquerque is full of great people.  Some of these great people work
on really cool projects.  I'm continually surprised by the amount of
interesting stuff going on here.

One such project is [Web App
Wednesday](http://www.webappwednesday.com/), where on each Wednesday,
[Michael Bernstein](http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbernstein)
releases a new application.  He's already completed two; one is the
Web App Wednesday site itself, and the other is [F/OSS License
Info](http://license-info.appspot.com/).  The apps are all
[AGPLv3](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) licensed
and written using Google's [AppEngine](http://code.google.com/appengine/).

The licensing info is quite interesting.  The GPL nearly four times as
popular as any other license, with the LGPL its closest competitor.
For all the whining people seem to do about the GPL and LGPL, it's
clear that most people think it's a great choice.  I'm hoping we see a
rise in the AGPLv3 license's popularity as time goes on; right now
it's at a measly 0.102%.

I absolutely love this weekly app idea, and I'll be checking in each
week to see what new application appears.  It's like the Web hacker's
version of [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/).
