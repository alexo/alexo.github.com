Lots of people have been writing new clients and new servers lately, and [SASL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) is one of the tougher parts of getting started on that path.  Robert Norris once wrote a pretty good guide on the [DIGEST-MD5](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt) method, but his server has since disappeared.  Luckily, someone dug it out of [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org), and now everyone can enjoy ["A Crash Course in SASL and DIGEST-MD5 for XMPP"](http://web.archive.org/web/20050224191820/http://cataclysm.cx/wip/digest-md5-crash.html).

Please note that if you can grok the DIGEST-MD5 method, the [PLAIN](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4616.txt) method is pretty simple.  Now you don't have to explore several RFCs to find this information.
