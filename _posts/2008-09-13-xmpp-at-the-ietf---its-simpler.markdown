There are two competing protocols within the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org) for instant messaging and presence.  One is [XMPP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3920.txt), and the other is [SIMPLE](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-simple-simple-03.txt).  Which one will prevail in the end?  My money is on XMPP.

SIMPLE is ironically named, as it is actually quite complex.  I don't tend to hear much about SIMPLE, but it does come up on the [XMPP mailing lists](http://xmpp.org/about/discuss.shtml) from time to time.  What I didn't know until recently was that the IETF [already uses XMPP](http://jabber.ietf.org/) for their meetings.  Even within the IETF the choice has been made.  

The SIMPLE specification isn't even complete yet, and XMPP is becoming quite entrenched.  I suspect we will continue to hear less and less about SIMPLE.
