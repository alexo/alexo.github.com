I've already been busy planning my 2010 event calendar. There are
some great conferences this year. You'll find me at the following events:

In February (5th-8th), I'll be attending the [8th XMPP
Summit](http://xmpp.org/summit/summit8.shtml) in Brussels. I plan to
give at least one talk on
[Strophe.js](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe) while there. The food
and beer in Brussels is amazing, and many great XMPP hackers and
enthusiasts turn up. I hope to see everyone there!

In early March (12th-16th), I'll be at [SXSW
Interactive](http://sxsw.com/interactive) on a [panel about the
real-time web](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/4390), which is
being organized by Brett Slatkin of Google. I first met Brett at an
XMPP meetup where he demoed
[PubSubHubBub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/), and I expect
this panel will be great.

In late March (25th and 26th), I'll be at [Erlang
Factory](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2010) in San
Francisco. Last year's Erlang factory was amazing, and there were some
amazing talks. I'll be discussing [how and why Collecta uses
Erlang](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2010/speakers/jackmoffit).
