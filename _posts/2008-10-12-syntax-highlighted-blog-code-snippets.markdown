I recently came across a blog which had excellent code snippets.  They had line numbers, syntax highlighting, and could be copied directly to the clipboard.  After doing a bit of Googling, I finally came across [syntaxhighlighter](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter) which enables these features with a could of lines of JavaScript and CSS and an extra two paramters on your &lt;pre> tags.

Here's an example:

<code>
<pre name='code' class='xml'>
&lt;pre name='code' class='python&gt;
print "Hello, World!"
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
</code>

which produces:

<code>
<pre name='code' class='python'>
print "Hello, World!"
</pre>
</code>

Now my snippets will have some visual beauty and will hopefully be easier to work with.  For those of you pasting code in your blogs, I highly recommend this.
