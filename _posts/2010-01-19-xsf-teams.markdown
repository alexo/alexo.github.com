One of the big changes the [XMPP Standards Foundation
(XSF)](http://xmpp.org) has made recently is to create special
[teams](http://xmpp.org/xsf/teams/) that are in charge of handling
various internal tasks. Each member is expected to serve on at least
one of these teams, and by spreading the work load among a group of
interested individuals, more work gets done.

Currently there are three of these teams, one each for
[communication](http://xmpp.org/xsf/teams/communication/), [technical review](http://xmpp.org/xsf/teams/techreview/), and [infrastructure](http://xmpp.org/xsf/teams/infrastructure/).

The communications team is charged with maintaining the XSF
[wiki](http://wiki.xmpp.org) and [web site](http://xmpp.org),
keeping updates flowing on the [blog](http://blog.xmpp.org), producing
presentations, tutorials, and other guides for the XMPP community, and
editorial reviews of
[extensions](http://xmpp.org/extensions/). Currently the most effort
has been focused on writing and reviewing blog posts.

The infrastructure team handles the machines and software that power the
[xmpp.org](http://xmpp.org) services. There are a lot of moving parts,
and this team does an excellent job of keeping them well oiled. Most
of the work of this team is usually invisible, but it's important to
remember their important efforts even when we can't see them.

The technical review team evaluates extensions at each stage of their
progress and provides advice to the [XSF
Council](http://xmpp.org/council/) and others. It is extremely helpful
to have a wide range of people reviewing each extension, but it is
easy for less popular extensions to fall through the cracks. The idea
behind the technical review team is to make sure that there is a
minimum coverage level for everything, hopefully improving the quality
of XMPP extensions even further.

It's great to see the XSF get more organized; it is a sign of the
growth of XMPP and the maturation of the XSF.

I just noticed that I have yet to sign up for one of these teams
officially. Hopefully the technical review team and the communications
teams will have me. If you are an XSF member, I encourage you to
volunteer for one of these teams; many hands make light work. If you
are not an XSF member, the XSF is [currently accepting membership
applications](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_January_2010)
until the end of the month for the upcoming election.
