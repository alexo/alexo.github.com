I had the pleasure of hanging out with [Pedro Melo](http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/) for a few days in Lisbon, and we had a lot of fun throwing around crazy XMPP related ideas.  Of course, such crazy ideas are not new for Pedro; just take a look at [Rasputine](http://github.com/melo/rasputine/tree/master).  

Rasputine is a gateway from XMPP to telnet which Pedro wrote for playing on a Lambda Moo called [Moosaico](http://moosaico.com/), but it can be used for far more.  For example, since routers usually support telnet administration, you could add them as friends and manipulate them via XMPP.  Just imagine the crazy things you could do if you could add commands to Rasputine to have those friends join a MUC.  Synchronized routing changes!

Pedro has also written about Rasputine a [couple](http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2008/11/rasputine.html) of [times](http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2008/11/other_uses_for.html).  Go check it out, and keep and eye out in case any of our joint plans come to life.
