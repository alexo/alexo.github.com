<blockquote>
  I think that maintaining your technical chops is a full time job. For that reason I have avoided becoming a business wonk. I hire people to do that for me so I can keep my technical skills as sharp as possible and remain relevant to my profession. I donâ€™t believe I can offer technical advice unless I am living that technical advice.
