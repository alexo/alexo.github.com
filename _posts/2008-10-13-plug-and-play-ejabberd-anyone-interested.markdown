We've been using Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud for almost a year now, and we love it.  I've had this idea for a while now to set up a public AMI (Amazon Machine Instance) set up with [ejabberd]j(http://www.ejabberd.im) in several configurations.  The idea would be that with an Amazon AWS account you could boot an instance of the image, assign it an IP, and have your own XMPP server ready to go.

Before I go to the trouble of preparing such an image, I figured I would see if anyone is actually interested in such a thing.  If you are interested, please let me know.  Also, I'm curious what features you might like to see in an XMPP server image.

If other server developers are interested in doing the same thing, I'm happy to assist.  Perhaps we can make interchangeable images for each of the major servers, and post the AMI information and instructions on [xmpp.org](http://www.xmpp.org).  I think something like this would make it extremely easy for people to test out the servers against each other, and it would make an excellent neutral ground for benchmark and compatibility testing.
