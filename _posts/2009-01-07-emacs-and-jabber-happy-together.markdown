My Emacs talk has been rubbing off on
[Dustin](http://bleu.west.spy.net/~dustin/); he has been experimenting
with his own Emacs setup for the last few days.  He sent me this
screenshot of the Emacs XMPP client, and I just had to share it.  It's
a little crude looking, but I had no idea that the Emacs client would
have avatar support.
