I'm very excited that the [Xiph.org Foundation](http://www.xiph.org) has finally [released](http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/theora/2008-November/001921.html) [Theora](http://www.theora.org) 1.0.  This is a big step forward for patent-free open multimedia codecs.  The team has come a long way since the original rewrite of [On2's](http://on2.com/) VP3 codec, and Monty, Ivo, Ralph, and the rest of the team deserve high praise for their work.

Not only do we have a Theora 1.0, but [Firefox](http://www.firefox.com) and [Opera](http://www.opera.com) are also supporting both [Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com) and Theora with the new &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags.

Last time I talked to Monty, he was busy hacking on Ghost, which is his newly designed super-codec for audio.  I can't wait to hear it!

If you believe in open, royalty and patent-free multimedia standards, please consider [donating](http://www.xiph.org/donate/).

*Full Disclosure:* I was previously the executive director of the Xiph.org Foundation and currently serve as a board member.
