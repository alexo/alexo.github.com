[Techcrunch50](http://www.techcrunch50.com/) is underway, and one of the early darlings is [Yammer](http://www.yammer.com).  Yammer is Twitter for businesses, allowing companies to have microblogging silos where their employees can communicate and keep track of each other.  Unlike [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca), Yammer has XMPP built right into the Web application, and it is powered by [Strophe](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe).

I met Adam Pisoni, one of the Yammer developers, at the recent [XMPP Summit](http://www.xmpp.org/summit/summit5.shtml) in Portland.  He approached me after a short talk on Strophe and [Chesspark](http://www.chesspark.com/) asking about a few issues he had run into with the library.  We figured out the issues, used his feedback to improve the API, and now we can see the results of his labors with Yammer.

Congratulations to Adam and the rest of the Yammer team on their launch!
