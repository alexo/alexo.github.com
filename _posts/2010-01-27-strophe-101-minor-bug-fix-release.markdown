[Strophe.js](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe) 1.0.1 is now
available. This version has a couple of minor bug fixes for issues
that were found right after the 1.0 release. If you were not affected
by these, there is no need to upgrade. Please let me know if you have
any issues.

You can read about the specific issues fixed in [ticket #75](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe/ticket/75).
