A few weeks ago I gave a presentation called *Exploring XMPP* at [SAPO Codebits '08](http://codebits.sapo.pt).  My new friends at SAPO have just informed me that a video version of the talk is available now for all to enjoy.  You can [watch it here](http://codebits.eu/intra/s/session/11); the video is about half way down the page.

The talk explorers a hypothetical application similar to [MRTG](http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/) but built on top of [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org) instead of SNMP.  I start with XMPP basics including the network, addressing, and a small primer on the three main stanza types.  After that, I jump write into the various bits of protocol to build the application.  I talk about presence, [service discovery](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html), [ad-hoc commands](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0050.html), and [pubsub](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html); all of these pieces are used for various parts of the application.

I'd love to know what you think of the talk or if you have any suggestions.  I'll use the feedback to improve future talks.
