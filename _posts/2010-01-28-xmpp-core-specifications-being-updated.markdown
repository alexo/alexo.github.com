Nothing is ever perfect, not even [XMPP](http://xmpp.org). For a
number of years, the community has been collecting and processing the
feedback on the [core XMPP
specifications](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/). This has been used to draft
updated versions of both [RFC
3920](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-xmpp-3920bis) and [RFC
3921](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-xmpp-3921bis).

An [IETF](http://ietf.org) working group, [XMPP
WG](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/xmpp/), has also been recently formed to
shepherd the new versions of these documents and accomplish some other
related protocol work (such as
[DNA](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/xmpp/draft-ietf-xmpp-dna/) and [end to
end security requirements](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/xmpp/draft-ietf-xmpp-e2e-requirements/)).

Anyone can get involved with this process simply by participating on
the [XMPP WG mailing
list](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/xmpp/current/maillist.html). The
IETF has an open participation policy.

[Peter](http://stpeter.im) has been doing a bit of work recently, and
the mailing list is starting to be fairly interesting. I encourage
everyone to take a peek and participate. If nothing else, watching
standards materialize is fascinating.
