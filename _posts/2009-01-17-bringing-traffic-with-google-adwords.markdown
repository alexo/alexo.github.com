Every new site much initially start with no users and no content.  For
sites which are community based, no users means no value.  How then do
new sites bootstrap to overcome this first hurdle?  One way is to
convince all your friends to come try it out; another way is to fake
it by talking to yourself.  At [Chesspark](http://www.chesspark.com)
we used Google Adwords to accomplish this quickly and cheaply.

:EXTENDED:

## Phase Zero

We first tried to recruit friends and friends of friends to help
populate Chesspark during the early days.  Unfortunately, there was
just too much time to fill for a site where games are live for our
friends to do the job.

We decided to try and throw money at the problem.

## Phase One

Our first attempt to use Google Adwords was pretty naive.  We set a
reasonable daily budget, bid on relevant keywords, and started a
campaign.

The campaign successfully brought new users to our site, but
unfortunately the rate at which they came was low enough that they
rarely overlapped.  One user would come, look around, see an empty
site, and leave.  Moments later this sequence would be repeated by
another new user.

We tried getting everyone in the company to hang out and play with new
users, but they quickly grew board with only a handful of opponents.

We had to get smarter.

## Phase Two

In order to make more people show up at once, we configured Google
Adwords to spend our entire daily budget in a single hour.  We picked
an hour that we were all willing to be around and playing games.

This had an immediate effect.  Instead of a long trickle of new users
over 24 hours, we had a short flood of new users when the campaign
started every day.  All those new users saw the site was alive and
well even though all the other users were new as well.

This was enough to maintain their interest, and our users began to
stick around!

Over the next few weeks we accrued more new users, and we were able to
expand our Adwords campaign from one hour to a full 24 hours.  Pretty
soon we found ourselves with a site that had a life of its own.

## More Than One Way

There's many ways to build communities, but those initial days are
tough for everyone.  Making use of cheap Internet advertising worked
well for us.

I've been meaning to write about this for some time, but had forgotten
all about it.  I had the good fortune to speak on a community
building panel today for [NM MIX](http://nm-mix.ning.com), and the
memories of the early days popped into my head.

I heard many good stories of how other local Albuquerque communities
got their starts.  Please share yours in the comments!
