<a href="http://metric-fu.rubyforge.org/">Metric_fu</a> just released version 1.1.0 of their gem which I'm pleased to say includes a <a href="http://github.com/jscruggs/metric_fu/commit/573afaf19e7a578aa0b161569290169d9298cf96">patch submitted by me</a>.  This is exciting as its the first time I've had my code included by someone I don't know in one of the open source projects I admire.<br /><br />I was not originally going to make the patch as I thought I'd just hack around to fix the problem locally just enough to get it working but my friend <a href="http://www.theagiledeveloper.com/">Matt</a> encouraged me to fix the root cause which turned out to be not too hard and got me into the metric_fu source.  I always learn something when I read source from others I admire.<br /><br />The process of submitting the patch was pretty easy and I plan to make it a habit when I run into issues with other gems.  I,<br /><ol><li>Experienced a problem and decided not to live with it<br /></li><li>Created a <a href="http://github.com/alexrothenberg/metric_fu">fork of metric_fu</a> on github</li><li>Cloned locally and iteratively made my changes until I had my fix complete</li><li>Rebased my changes into a single commit (I wrote <a href="http://www.alexrothenberg.com/2009/06/changing-history-with-git-rebase-how-to.html">an article</a> on this a few weeks ago)</li><li>Pushed my patch back to github on <a href="http://github.com/alexrothenberg/metric_fu/tree/runtime_dependencies">a branch</a></li><li>Submitted my patch back to Jake's repository as <a href="http://github.com/jscruggs/metric_fu/issues#issue/1">an issue</a><br /></li></ol><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Solving the problem of gem dependencies with github names</span><br /><br />I am using <a href="http://github.com/relevance/rcov">relevance-rcov</a> instead of the rubyforge version of rcov as it has been maintained more recently and specifically fixed a segmentation fault problem I previously faced.  The problem is that I couldn't install metric_fu as it put a gem dependency on 'rcov' in its gemspec.  What seems broken is that there's no way to put a dependency on 'rcov' but have rubygems realize that 'relevance-rcov' is a fork of rcov so should satisfy the dependency.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of talk recently about rubygems (including <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/why-using-require-rubygems-is-wrong-1478.html">Why Using require ‘rubygems’ Is Wrong</a>, <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/06/15/rubygems-problems-and-proposed-solutions">RubyGems: Problems and (proposed) Solutions</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/rip-ruby-packaging-system-1837.html">Rip: A Next Generation Ruby Packaging System - Watch Out RubyGems!</a>) but so far I haven't found a solution to the forking and naming problem emerge.<br /><br />For Metric_fu I decided to change the install-time dependency to a runtime one.  This solves my basic problem of not finding relevance-rcov but also allows for more flexibile use of metric_fu.  If someone does not want to generate reek or rcov metrics why should they be forced to install those gems in order to use metric_fu?  By defering the dependency until runtime we will never hit the dependency for those metrics we are not using.<br /><br />You can look through the <a href="http://github.com/jscruggs/metric_fu/commit/573afaf19e7a578aa0b161569290169d9298cf96">commit</a> to see exactly how I did this.<br /><ol><li>Deleted the install time dependencies from metric_fu.gemspec</li><li>Added the runtime dependencies when a specific type of metric is instantiated by</li><ul><li>Inserting a verify_dependencies! strategy step to the initialization in lib/base/generator.rb</li><li>Implementing verify_dependencies! in each of the subclasses for different metrics in lib/generators/*<br /></li></ul><li>Did it with TDD writing tests around everything before implementing my changes<br /></li></ol><br />Should gems use install time dependencies? Should a gem author decide which fork of a gem is required?
