XSF Board and Council elections have completed for 2008-2009, and this year marks a notable increase in interest in these positions.  For the first time ever, five board members were elected instead of just three, and the council had real competition among the applicants with 6 people vying for 5 spots.  It's great to see the XSF growing and new people stepping up to help the organization in a formal role.  I'm pleased to serve another year on the XSF Board (my third term) and to serve once again on the Council (my second term).  It's not too late for you to participate if you haven't already; the XSF Membership elections are coming up very soon.

## The New Board

This year's board members are the same as last year's with the addition of two new faces: [David Banes](http://wiki.jabber.org/web/David_Banes_for_Board_2008) and [Will Sheward](http://wiki.jabber.org/web/Will_Sheward_for_Board_2008).

With Alex, David, Mickael, and myself we have four founders/CEOs on board, and Will will round that out with his marketing experience.  It's about time we had some marketing chops on the XSF board, since many of our meetings are marketing related.

I look forward to working again with Alex and Mickael and to hearing the new ideas from Dave and Will.

## The New Council

The new council has four of the same members.  [Remko](http://wiki.jabber.org/web/Remko_Troncon_for_Council_2008) and I had the pleasure of competing for the remaining spot which I won by a small margin.  It was interesting to have decision to make this year on who to vote four, and the member voting bot had to be recoded to randomize the candidates since we had more of them than spots.

The XSF Council has a busy year ahead.  Interest in XMPP is higher than ever, and much of that interest is around new and draft specifications.  Peter has already sent out the [draft agenda](http://xmpp.org/council/agendas/2008-10-08.html) for the first meeting on Wednesday, and if its length is any indication, this will be a hugely productive year for the XSF and XMPP.

## Come Join Us

You can become a member of the XSF as well.  We hold quarterly elections to vote new members in, and these new members are responsible for electing the XSF Board and Council as well as participating in some policy discussions from time to time.  Members also frequently represent the XSF at events all over the world.  Membership also has some privileges; in the past, the XSF has paid for accommodations for members attending the XMPP Summits.

We'd love to have your help in making the XSF bigger and better.
