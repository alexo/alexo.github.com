[Neuros](http://www.neurostechnology.com/) just launched their [crowd narration feature](http://open.neurostechnology.com/content/participate-us-presidential-debate-crowd-narration) for their Neuros OSD video device.  Crowd narration uses XMPP (via [Strophe](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe)) to let viewers interact with each other.  Currently OSD owners have to use the [narration Web site](http://narration.neuros.tv/) to talk, but all viewers see the chat right on their screens.

This is yet another example of a company making great use of XMPP.  I wonder how long it will be before Comcast, DirecTV and TiVo start eyeing XMPP for similar purposes.
