This interesting question was asked on a [local Albuquerque site](http://dukecityfix.com).  Here's my answer:

> I think of startups as people trying to do something new, whether it be a new way to mix
> cement, or a new way to push packets on the Internet. These people are explorers of 
> their spaces. I think artists have occupied this domain since there was art, even if they
> didn't have a special word for it; for those of us making art of technology and other
> businesses, we call it a startup.
