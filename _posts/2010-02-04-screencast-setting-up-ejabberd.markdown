The following screencast is on how to download, install, configure,
and run a basic ejabberd server. The server configuration includes the
bits needed to do web development with XMPP.

This screencast is really a trial run for a series of Strophe-related
screencasts I'm planning. Please let me know what you think. In
particular, is the sound and video quality good? Were the fonts
visible and large enough? Was the pace too fast or too slow?

Also, while I plan to do several of these types of videos for free, if
I'm going to do a polished series of them, it will take a substantial
amount of my free time. Is this something you would be willing to pay
a small amount for?

And finally, I'd love to hear topic suggestions. I was thinking that
I'd do a similar video for Prosody, Openfire, and Tigase if people
thought that would be interesting.
