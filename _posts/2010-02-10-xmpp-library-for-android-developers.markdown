Mobile XMPP development came up over and over at the recent [XMPP
Summit](http://xmpp.org/summit/summit8.shtml). With several Java
libraries to choose from for desktop XMPP development, one would
imagine that these would work easily on Android, which is also Java
based. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the currently Java
libraries don't seem to work. Thankfully, the
[BuddyCloud](http://buddycloud.com/) team has released
[asmack](http://asmack.googlecode.com), which is a fork of the
[SMACK](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/) library
customized for the Android platform.

If you're thinking of getting into mobile XMPP development on Android,
you should definitely check this out.
