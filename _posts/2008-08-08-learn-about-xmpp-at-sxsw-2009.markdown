I submitted two XMPP themed proposals for <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW 2009</a>.  The <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com">interactive panel picker</a> is now open, so please go vote for my entries if you have any interest in XMPP at SXSW.  As far as I can tell, I'm the only one speaking on the topic.

The first submission is a panel called "<a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1933">The XMPP Powered Web</a>".
<blockquote>XMPP is being used to build the next generation of Web applications. The open messaging standard has crossed from the desktop to the Web and is powering applications for microblogging, gaming, social networks, communication, and data portability. Learn how others are using XMPP and how you can use it, too.</blockquote>
I am planning to invite some well known developers using XMPP for interesting Web projects to join me.  Google, Flickr, Seesmic, Chesspark, and others are already building on XMPP technology into the Web, and it is time for the rest of the world to get into the game as well.  Vote <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1933">here</a>.

The second proposal is a solo talk about XMPP basics called "<a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1934">X Is For XMPP: An Open Messaging Primer</a>".
<blockquote>XMPP is an open, extensible messaging standard designed for instant messaging and presence. The protocol is based on XML and is simple and easy to understand. XMPP can be used to power next generation Web apps. Learn how XMPP works and how you can use it in your own applications.</blockquote>
I'll cover the basics of the protocol and dive into various ways XMPP can be used.  I'll cover the big XEPs like Pubsub, BOSH, and MUC, as well as topics like using components and writing bots.  Vote <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1934">here</a>.

If any of you are planning to be at SXSW 2009, let me know.  I'd love to meet more people building cool things with XMPP.
