I was finally able to track down some documentation for [Zephyr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(software\)).  Here is the [general user documentation](http://www.cs.duke.edu/csl/docs/zephyr/).  [Gale](http://gale.org/) is a similar system that uses public key cryptography, but shares a lot of other properties with Zephyr.

The interesting thing is that users subscribe to other users, to subsets of the postings of a user, or to arbitrary groups or subsets of those groups.  The structure is reminiscent of Usenet, with names like `help.windows.networking`.  It amazes me that that we're just now getting around to seeing these ideas become widespread.
