While at [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org), [Peter](http://stpeter.im)
suggested that XMPP needs a collective noun for stanzas.  We have a
pack of dogs, a herd of cattle, and (my favorite) a murder of crows.

Two good ideas were suggested:

> an **octavo** of stanzas

or

> a **folio** of stanzas

See [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) for the meanings of
[octavo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavo_(book\)) and [folio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio). Personally, I like the former.  What about you?
