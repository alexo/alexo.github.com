I'll be teaching a three day course on ejabberd and XMPP applications
at the next Erlang Factory in San Francisco. I'll also be speaking at
the conference about how Erlang gives me superpowers. The course will
be March 21st through March 23rd, and the Erlang Factory conference
will be on the 24th and 25th.

I'll be covering everything from XMPP basics and installing ejabberd
to writing your own extensions, web services, and clients. See the
[full course
description](http://erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2011/university/XMPPwithErlang)
for more information.

You can register for Erlang Factory, including the course, or get more
information about the event at [Erlang Factory SF
2011](http://erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2011).

I highly recommend this conference if you are interested at all in
Erlang. There are some amazing talks each year, and the conference is
always well run (this will be my third year attending).

I hope to see you there!
