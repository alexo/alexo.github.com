[Gar](http://sysadminco.com/) has just put up the first preview of his new [Strophe](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe) project, [TrophyIM](http://code.google.com/p/trophyim/).  It's still rough, but it is shaping up nicely.  You just add a &lt;div&gt; tag to your Web page with a special id attribute, and TrophyIM takes care of the rest.  You can see the [live demo](http://sysadminco.com/scripts/trophyim/?), but be aware that it may break if Gar is actively coding on it.

It's always nice to see more people using Strophe.
