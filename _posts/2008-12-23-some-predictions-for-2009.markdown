[Nathan](http://unclenaynay.com), my fellow developer at
[Stanziq](http://stanziq.com) was recently asked about his technology
predictions for 2009.  I thought his answer was excellent, and with
his permission, I include it below.

For me, the key point is:

> There will be a move beyond the current ajax applications to make the internet more real time.

Nathan's full answer:

> I think in 2009 we are going to see some changes in internet
  applications.  There will be a move beyond the current ajax
  applications to make the internet more real time.  An example of the
  beginnings of this is the live twitter search and 'live feed'
  feature in facebook.  In 2009 we should see internet sites move
  towards pushing their data out in a live stream.  The new internet
  apps will take advantage of these live streams to create some very
  nice internet applications.  My favorite example is the Noaa website
  pushing out their buoy data and kayak.com pushing out their flight
  information. Now combine the two real time feeds and you have an
  application that will tell you the cheapest way to get to get to
  good waves!  Of course mashups are old news, but real time data and
  search is not.  Another example is a regular static search along
  with a real time feed that shows "What are people saying about 'my
  query' now?".  This section will show all the micro-blogs or
  comments made about search results, all in real-time.  I only make
  this prediction because its what our new company, [http://stanziq.com](http://stanziq.com)
  , is creating.  If we have anything to do with it, this is what will
  happen in 2009 :)
