I'll be moderating a panel Monday at the [San Francisco Music Tech Summit](http://sfmusictech.com/).  If anyone local wants to get together while I'm in town, please let me know.

The SF Music Tech Summit is a great little conference put on by my friend Brian Zisk which explores the intersection of two of his favorite fields, music and technology.  From venture capitalists talking about funding to labels talking about how to use technology to promote music, the summit has much to offer.

Of course, I'll be there telling everyone who'll listen about XMPP.
